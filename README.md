Welcome to Blackjack!

Game Description:
Blackjack or "21" is a game of chance where players attempt to beat the dealer by having the highest card count or getting a card count as close to 21 as possible without going over 21. Having a value of 21 results in a "Blackjack" and if the dealer cannot match 21, the player wins! Having a card value over 21 results in a "Bust" and automatically results in a loss.

Card Values:
The masterdeck has a total of 52 cards. All numbered cards is its pip value with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) equaling a value of 10 and Aces worth either 11 or 1. 

How to play:
Once start game is clicked, all players will receive two cards face up. However, the dealer will only reveal one card and has the other card face down. Players will decide whether to "Hit" or "Stand". Hit will allow the player to receive one card while Stand will end the player turn. If the player card total isn't over 21, the player can choose to either "Hit" or "Stand" again. If the player card value is 21, the player has "Blackjack" and will end their turn. If the player card value is over 21, they "Bust" and automatically lose the game.

Dealer's turn:
Once the player has decided to stand or has blackjack, the dealer will begin their play. The hidden card is revealed and if the dealer card value is under 17, the dealer must hit. The dealer will continue to hit until their card value is over 17 where they must stand. Both the player and dealer card values are compared and whoever has the highest card value wins! If the dealer card value is over 21, the dealer will bust and the player wins! If both the player and the dealer has the same card value, the game results in a tie.
