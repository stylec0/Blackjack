Having a value of 21 results in a "Blackjack" and if the dealer cannot match 21, the player wins! Having a card value over 21 results in a "Bust" and automatically results in a loss.

If the player card total isn't over 21, the player can choose to either "Hit" or "Stand" again. If the player card value is 21, the player has "Blackjack" and will end their turn. If the player card value is over 21, they "Bust" and automatically lose the game.
